# Feature-Engineering
# ML Regression Project – Baseline vs Feature Engineering (TensorFlow)

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a practical machine learning regression workflow using TensorFlow, focusing on comparing a simple baseline model against a feature-engineered model.

The goal is to measure how feature engineering impacts model performance using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** as the evaluation metric.
